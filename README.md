## example


``` main run file:
./0-run-Raman.sh  
```

ref: https://github.com/raman-sc/VASP  

Unit cell parameters were taken from the [phonopy](http://phonopy.sourceforge.net) example folder. Silicon unit cell contains 8 atoms, thus 24 frequencies (phonons), three acoustic close to zero.  

For this example `vasp_raman.py` script version [0.5.1] (https://raw.github.com/raman-sc/VASP/3cb3cdf0682609365c4b966472ef6eb5be1defc5/vasp_raman.py) was used.  

Raman intensities for all modes will be computed in one go. For the multi-step procedure see [Cyclopentadiene example](https://github.com/raman-sc/VASP/tree/master/Cyclopentadiene).  

Working directory should contain the following files (`FAT` file system has different soft linking ways):
```
INCAR        - should contain LEPSILON=.TRUE. or LCALCEPS=.TRUE. because we want 'MACROSCOPIC STATIC DIELECTRIC TENSOR' in the OUTCAR
KPOINTS      - just kpoints (soft link of the KPOINTS file from the PHONON folder, to prevent errors)
OUTCAR.phon  - should contain 'Eigenvectors after division by SQRT(mass)' either from VASP (soft link of the OUTCAR file from the PHONON folder)
POSCAR.phon  - VASP5 format is *required* (atomic symbols and numbers), at this point only positive scales are supported (soft link of the POSCAR file from the PHONON folder)
POTCAR       - `PAW_PBE Si 05Jan2001` PP (soft link to the POTCAR file from the PHONON folder)
raman.sub    - shell script for the scheduler to *do the deed*
```
